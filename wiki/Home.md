# Welcome to the qpdf wiki!

The intention is to use this wiki for information that may be useful but hasn't made it into the
main documentation. Please see the list of pages on the sidebar.

The wiki also provides some information about recent and planned changes, including changes planned
for qpdf 12 and the next steps in the [[pages epic|Pages epic : next steps]], the work to support
more document-level structures (such as the preservation of outlines) and page level
transformations (such as scaling). The information either has not made it into the manual yet, or
goes into more detail than is provided in the manual and release notes.

## Planned changes

### Treatment of uninitialized QPDFObjectHandles and null objects

Changes to the treatment of uninitialized object handles and null objects are planned for both qpdf
11.10 and qpdf 12. for details see

- [[PDF null objects vs qpdf null objects]]
- [[Use of default constructed object handles in qpdf to indicate failure or error]]
